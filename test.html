Gold may glitter, but it may not matter to those who like to think Pink. Luckily Samsung has found a way to satiate both sides of the situation, as it has just announced the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge will come in Pink Gold! As for why Samsung has decided to offer this – now the fifth color choice – option, it had the following to say: Pink Gold was chosen as it, like the other colors available for the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, is a natural color that provides a sense of comfort. These hues glitter and shimmer as if illuminated from inside their glass surfaces.
In particular, the refined, skin tone-inspired Pink Gold color scheme is intended to soothe and incorporate a touch of gentleness, radiance and sophistication to the smartphones’ design. The new colors go on sale today (April 20th) in South Korea, following a wider release soon in “select markets”. Samsung has not specified which other territories or countries, however based on products like the Galaxy A (2016) line, many of them will likely be in Asia.
